### Steps to Fit Bayesian Models in R ###

#### 1. Specify the Research Question
- Define the hypotheses you want to test and determine the variables involved.

#### 2. Prepare the Data
- Clean and preprocess your data, ensuring all variables are correctly formatted.
- For categorical variables, ensure they are factors with the correct reference levels.

#### 3. Specify the Model
- Define your model formula, including fixed effects, interactions, and random effects.
- Choose the appropriate family for your response variable (e.g., `cumulative` for ordinal data).
- Set priors based on your knowledge or use default weakly informative priors.

#### 4. Fit the Model
- Use the `brm()` function to fit the model, specifying the formula, data, priors, and MCMC parameters (e.g., number of iterations, chains, cores).

#### Example:
```r
model <- brm(formula = strategy ~ face * number * QUD + (1 + face | subject),
             data = exp2youxie, 
             family = cumulative(link = "logit"),
             prior = set_prior("normal(0, 1)", class = "b"),
             iter = 4000, 
             warmup = 1000, 
             chains = 4, 
             cores = 4)
```
