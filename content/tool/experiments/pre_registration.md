# Preregistration

Preregistration is the practice of documenting your research plan at the beginning of your study and storing that plan in a read-only public repository, such as [OSF Registries](https://osf.io/registries?view_only=) or [As Predicted.org](https://aspredicted.org/).

## Benefits of Preregistration

1. **Clarity**: Ensures that research teams share a clear understanding of their research goals and processes.  
2. **Transparency**: Separates the confirmatory aspects of the research from the exploratory aspects.  
3. **Collaboration**: Allows for input from colleagues online prior to conducting the study.  
4. **Pre-acceptance**: Enables journal editors to accept researchers’ papers conditionally, regardless of the outcomes.
