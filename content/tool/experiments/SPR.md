### Self-Paced Reading  
Self-paced reading (SPR) is relatively crude-grained in the behavioral data it provides. Nevertheless, it remains one of the most accessible tools for beginners conducting experimental language research.

Below are some helpful resources for learning and implementing SPR experiments:

### Tools for Building SPR Studies  
The first tool I used to build my SPR study was **[Linger](https://web.archive.org/web/20191220181934/http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Linger/ "Linger site")**.  

**[OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/4.0/)** is another excellent option for creating SPR experiments.
