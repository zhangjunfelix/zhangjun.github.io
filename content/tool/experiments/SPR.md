Self-paced reading is relatively crude-grained in the behavioural data, it, nevertheless, is one of the most accessible tools for beginners in doing experimental language research.

The following are some helpful links.

1. [Online Experiments for Language Scientists](https://kennysmithed.github.io/oels2022/)   
   Week 4 self paced reading  
      
2. 



The first tool that I used to build my SRP study was [Linger](https://web.archive.org/web/20191220181934/http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Linger/ "Linger site").  
[OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/4.0/) is certainly a good choice.
