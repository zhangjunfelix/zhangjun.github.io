Learning about eyetracking technique is motivated by my interest in discovering cognitive processes involved in interpreting scalar quantifiers in social contexts.

My first experiments (hopefully) are about perspective-taking and interpreting scalars in social contexts, a project emerging from my discussion with Prof. Gerry Altmann.

In this post, I share my experience in learning about this technique in two areas: classical studies, experimental design, and data analysis.



- Part I Review



- Part II Classical Studies




- Part III  Experimental Design

There are several ways to build an eyetracking experiment. The first optinon is to use the Experiment Builder that comes with the Eyelink machine. The second option is to use open-source tools like OpenSesame and Psychopy.

OpenSesame:
Opensesame (Mathôt et al., 2012) together with the [PyGaze](http://www.pygaze.org) plugin (Dalmaijer et al., 2014). 

Resources for using PyGaze on OpenSesame:
1. [OpenSesame and PyGaze workshop in Potsdam](https://www.pygaze.org/2018/07/opensesame-and-pygaze-workshop-potsdam/)
2. [PyGaze (eye tracking)_OpenSesame website](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.2/manual/eyetracking/pygaze/)
3. [Visual World Experiment w/ PyGaze and OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.3/tutorials/visual-world/)

[Psychopy](https://psychopy.org/index.html) is another open-source tool that are used to create eyetracking experiments. These experiments are also supported by Eyelink.

Resources for Psychopy
1. [Communicating with an Eyetracker](https://psychopy.org/hardware/eyeTracking.html)
2. YT tutorial [PsychoPy Integration for EyeLink Eye Trackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tLJHVktrEk)
3. 

[Gorrilla](https://app.gorilla.sc/login)

2. [Eye Tracking in Task Builder 2](https://support.gorilla.sc/support/tools/task-builder-2/eye-tracking#overview)

Though Gorilla is great, I gave up this path, because there is a fee for recruiting participants. 


The path I took:
1. As I am relatively proficient with OpenSesame (I have used OpenSesame to create SPR tasks and mouse-tracking tasks), I designed a VW task by using PyGaze on OpenSesame.
