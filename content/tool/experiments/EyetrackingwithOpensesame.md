### Learning About Eye-Tracking Technique

Learning about the **eye-tracking technique** is motivated by my interest in discovering cognitive processes involved in interpreting scalar quantifiers in social contexts.

My first experiments (hopefully) are about **perspective-taking** and **interpreting scalars in social contexts**, a project emerging from my discussions with Prof. Gerry Altmann.

In this post, I share my experience in learning about this technique in three areas:
- Classical studies
- Experimental design
- Data analysis

#### Part I: Review

#### Part II: Classical Studies

#### Part III: Experimental Design

There are several ways to build an eye-tracking experiment.  
1. **Experiment Builder**: Provided with the EyeLink machine.  
2. **Open-source tools**: Tools like **OpenSesame** and **PsychoPy**.

##### OpenSesame  
OpenSesame (Mathôt et al., 2012), used together with the [PyGaze](http://www.pygaze.org) plugin (Dalmaijer et al., 2014).  

##### Resources for using PyGaze on OpenSesame:
1. [OpenSesame and PyGaze Workshop in Potsdam](https://www.pygaze.org/2018/07/opensesame-and-pygaze-workshop-potsdam/)  
2. [PyGaze (Eye Tracking) - OpenSesame Documentation](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.2/manual/eyetracking/pygaze/)  
3. [Visual World Experiment with PyGaze and OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.3/tutorials/visual-world/)

##### PsychoPy  
[PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/index.html) is another open-source tool that supports creating eye-tracking experiments. These experiments are compatible with EyeLink systems.

##### Resources for PsychoPy:
1. [Communicating with an Eye Tracker](https://psychopy.org/hardware/eyeTracking.html)  
2. [YouTube Tutorial: PsychoPy Integration for EyeLink Eye Trackers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tLJHVktrEk)

##### Gorilla  
[Gorilla](https://app.gorilla.sc/login) is also an option for creating eye-tracking experiments.

##### Resources for Gorilla:
1. [Eye Tracking in Task Builder 1](https://support.gorilla.sc/support/tools/legacy-tools/task-builder-1/eye-tracking#overview)  
2. [Eye Tracking in Task Builder 2](https://support.gorilla.sc/support/tools/task-builder-2/eye-tracking#overview)

**Note**: While Gorilla is a great tool, I chose not to use it because there is a fee for recruiting participants.

##### My Path
1. Since I am proficient with **OpenSesame** (I’ve used it for creating SPR tasks and mouse-tracking tasks), I designed a **Visual World (VW) task** using **PyGaze on OpenSesame**.

---

#### Part IV: Data Analysis

The data analysis focuses on experiments designed with **PyGaze**.
