[OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/4.0/) is a program to create experiments for psychology, neuroscience, and experimental economics.    

It does not require coding skills to create psycholinguistics experiments and is particularly friendly to beginners with a comprehensive graphical, point-and-click interface.   

You can find tutorials and example experiments on the website that are highly useful in learning to build your own experiments.    

Opensesame experiments can be implemented both offline and online. It has an extension called OSWEB that allows the experiments to be excuted in a browser.    

If you choose to go online, you'll need to recruit participants online. I used [Mturk](https://www.mturk.com) and [Jatos](https://www.jatos.org) in work.
