Given my view of languages as an critical part of human cognition, I would like to know more about the nature of this cognitive capability that seems to be only possessed by humans.

As a continuation of my research on language acquisition, I started to realize that, fascinating as linguistic competence may be, ignoring linguistic performance is not reasonable. 

After working on topics of non-native language processing, especially disambiguation, I ventered into pragmatic inferencing (mostly due to failure to produce any publication :confused: :sob: :disappointed: :scream: ). 

The issues that fascinate me include classical topics within pragmatics, some of which sit at the interface between semantics and pragmatics, such as conversational implicatures, (im)politeness, speech acts, and so on. They are fascinating for a few reasons. First, these phenomena offer critical windows to peek into the relationship between various modules within one's language knowledge. Second, they are so common that they can be witnessed in a multitude of everyday human activities. Third, these issues are not just linguistic behavior but are deeply entangled with human cognition/brain. Thus, empirical methods/tools are required to reveal their working. 

Here is a list of my projects.  
1.2019. Online processing of scalar implicatures by non-native speakers   
2.2020. An experimental study on the derivation of scalar implicatures.  
3.2023. A comparative study on embedded conversational implicatures in Chinese and English.


Some ideas are still cooking. :man_cook:  :bento: :dumpling:
