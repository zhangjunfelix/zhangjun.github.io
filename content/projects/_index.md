 Throughout my research over the last ten years, I have been mostly interested in understanding how human beings acquire languages and use them in commnuication. The first area of my research covers language acquisition, with a focus on non-native language acquisition. Specifically, one topic that I worked on was acquisition of knowledge at interfaces by second language learners, such as scope interaction. The second area of my research is understanding pragmatic competence by both native and non-native speakers. The projects that I have been working on focus on pragmatic inferencing.
