As a learner of English as a foreign language since age 13, I naturally wonder how my English always come short of native-like competence. Such curiosity drives me, as a linguist, further to investigate issues in non-native language acquisition and conduct research on these issues. 

Here is a link to my master's thesis.

While I was studying for my Ph.D., I expanded my interest into the area of first language acquisition as I was working on how syntactic knowledge was acquired.

Despite the fact that I step a bit away from L2 acquisition research, the training that I have recieved over the years has endowed me a unique perspective in my linguistic research. That is, I always ask a question of how L2 learners would acquire this or how they would use that. This is actually greatly helpful to generate some very good ideas for my current research agenda.

I am also teaching a course on L2 acquisition. You may find out more about this course in the website under Teaching.
